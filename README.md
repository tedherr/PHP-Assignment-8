# PHP-Assignment-8
This is the assignment.
Concepts you'll need to know to complete this assignment:

    Functions & passing parameters to functions
    Arrays (multi-dimensional arrays)
    Separating text into an array by a separator (the explode  (Links to an external site.)command)
    Conditionals (if the form has been submitted, display the results...otherwise display the form -- optionally display the form in both cases)
    Form processing (extracting form data via $_POST)

 Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O!
And on that farm he had a cow, E-I-E-I-O!
With a moo-moo here and a moo-moo there

Here a moo, there a moo, everywhere a moo-moo
Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O!



Your solution should include a function called printOneVerse, which will print one verse of the song. printOneVerse should take two arguments – the name of an animal name and the sound that animal makes.


You can create your own form, or use the HTML form provided here. Note that the values passed from the form are going to be of the form name:sound, which you’ll have to explode  (Links to an external site.)into parts.
